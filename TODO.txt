## NEXT THING TO DO


## High Priority

* Size capping. Maybe first read a small chunk of a file to determine if we need to
hash the file for real. Most of the time the first 100 bytes of files can deternie if they are dupes
* Defer hashing until two or more files have the same size.
* Consider BLAKE2 for hash algorithm primary.
* Handle ultra files


## Change user options:

* --show-progress should be changed to just --progress-interval
* --suppress-updates we can probably just get rid of.
* --cpuprofile change argument from "string" to "filename.prof"


## General internal mechanism to play wirh.

- Experiment with a worker pool of goroutines.
- Fix up logging/error handling output to user.



## ISSUES:

* Running dskDitto is very resource intensive. Running it on home directory can overload the system. Memory usage is high, but reasonable still.
May need to limit/throttle.
* Redis could possibly serve as another option for the dup store. I don't really want redis as 
a dependency by support may be added in the future.
