# TODO

## NEXT THING TO DO




Change user options:

--show-progress should be changed to just --progress-interval
--suppress-updates we can probably just get rid of.
--cpuprofile change argument from "string" to "filename.prof"


- Profile goroutine creation
- Experiment with a worker pool of goroutines.
- Fix up logging/error handling output to user.

- Add ability to configure open file desc count.
- Add table printer output
- Colorize the duplication results and seperate them so the user can see each cluster more easily.
- Output results to file.

## FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

* Fuzzy match duplication. Match files as duplicates so as long as they are within a similarity threshold.
* Output HTML/JSON
* Allow user to purge duplicates.

## OPTIMIZATIONS:

* Profiling has revealed that dfs.NewDfile is somewhat expensive becasuse of the MD5 hashing that
  takes place. We need to find a way to possibly optimize dfs.NewDfile() and MD5 hashing.


## ISSUES:

* Running dskDitto is very resource intensive. Running it on home directory can overload the system. Memory usage is high, but reasonable still.
May need to limit/throttle
