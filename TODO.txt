# TODO

- Add signal handling
- Add ability to configure open file desc count.
- Add table printer output
- Colorize the duplication results and seperate them so the user can see each cluster more easily.
- Test dskDitto cancellation.
- Output results to file.

## FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

* Use bubbles golang module to provide a more interactive TUI
* Fuzzy match duplication. Match files as duplicates so as long as they are within a similarity threshold.
* Output HTML/JSON
* Allow user to purge duplicates.

## OPTIMIZATIONS:

* Profiling has revealed that dfs.NewDfile is somewhat expensive becasuse of the MD5 hashing that
  takes place. We need to find a way to possibly optimize dfs.NewDfile() and MD5 hashing.


## ISSUES:

* Running dskDitto is very resource intensive. Running it on home directory can overload the system. Memory usage is high, but reasonable still.
May need to limit/throttle
