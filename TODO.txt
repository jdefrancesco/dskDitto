TODO:

FIX:
!! Hit file descriptor limit running dskDitto on home directory. macOS open fd's is very low, need to add semaphore
or lift soft limit

- Colorize the duplication results and seperate them so the user can see each cluster more easily.
- Test dskDitto cancellation.
- Output results to file.

FEATURES:

In the future I would like the following features:

* Fuzzy match duplication. Match files as duplicates so as long as they are within a similarity threshold.
* Output HTML/JSON
* Allow user to purge duplicates.

OPTIMIZATIONS:

* Profiling has revealed that dfs.NewDfile is somewhat expensive becasuse of the MD5 hashing that
  takes place. We need to find a way to possibly optimize dfs.NewDfile() and MD5 hashing.
