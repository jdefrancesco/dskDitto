TODO:

- Colorize the duplication results and seperate them so the user can see each cluster more easily.
- Test dskDitto cancellation.
- Add content to LICENSE file, decide what license I want to use, apache maybe?
- Output results to file.

FEATURES:

In the future I would like the following features:

* Fuzzy match duplication. Match files as duplicates so as long as they are within a similarity threshold.
* Output HTML/JSON
* Allow user to purge duplicates.
