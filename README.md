# dskDitto 

## About

DskDitto is a tiny utility written in Go that helps identify duplicate/useless files on your machine
in only a matter of seconds. It is highly concurrent, and efficient. The project is still in it's infancy
so many features are yet to be implemented. 

**WARNING:** Although in the future this tool will be cross-platform, I have only been testing/developing it on macOS.
