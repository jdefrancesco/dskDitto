# dskDitto 

## About

DskDitto is a tiny utility written in Go that helps identify duplicate/useless files on your machine
in only a matter of seconds. It is highly concurrent, and efficient. The project is still in its infancy
so many features are still yet to be implemented. 

## Building

NOTE: A Makefile will be created soon. For now you simply have to call `go build` yourself. 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dskDitto && cd dskDitto
$ go build 
$ mv ditto dskDitto # The executable created is called ditto which will conflict with another macOS utility called ditto. Simply rename it for now.
```
