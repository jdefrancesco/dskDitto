## About

`DskDitto` is a tiny utility written in Go that helps identify duplicate/useless files on your machine
in only a matter of seconds. It is highly concurrent, and efficient. Results are displayed in a slick looking TUI 
that allows you to select what you to keep or clobber.

of it all together..
